      <h3>What are your expectations in ICT 9</h3>
      <p>I quite have a lot of expectations due to my goal to finally prove the people I want to prove that I am better with laptops and computers. I also want to be good at coding and know new techniques in the computers or laptop. Last expectation of mine is that I would know more a lot about computers by grade 10.</p> <br>
