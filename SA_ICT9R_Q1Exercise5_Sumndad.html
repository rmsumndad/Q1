<h1>Introduction to div element</h1>
<div class="div1">
	<h2 align="center">What's one habit you want to get rid of and one habit you want to keep?</h2>
	<p align="center">One habit that I want to lose is the constant thought of always messing up. I overthink a lot and about every single thing but I can handle it. A habit I want to keep is song-writing. Through this, I can write about my feelings and emotions.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="div2">
	<h2 align="center">Do you think you're an introvert or an extrovert?</h2>
	<p align="center">I am definitely an ambivert. I am both introvert and extrovert. I prefer to be quiet and secretive about my personal life. However, I am open to my friends and people about some situations that happened in my life.</p>
